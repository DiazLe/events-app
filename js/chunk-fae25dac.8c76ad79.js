Eventually, realizing that a lot of these squirrels lack proper feeding grounds and discovering other squirrel rehabilitation centers, we decided to open up our own! Humans for Squirrels assists in rehabilitating lost and injured squirrels. We were able to build a center by hosting fundraising events and will continue to do so. We have discovered that squirrels really enjoy eating walnuts! If you would like to attend one of our fundraising events, tickets are sold at the door or you can contribute by gifting us a donation!")])])}],a=(n("7bcc"),n("2877")),s={},o=Object(a["a"])(s,i,r,!1,null,"729b706c",null);t["default"]=o.exports}}]);
